# Source files for the `vex` shell

This is currently a stub. A lot of the current features are being compiled, and commands 
available will be working well before the shell itself is pieced together. 

I am aiming for the shell to be substantially faster to work with compared to `zsh`. 

Expected completion is August, 2023. 

Stay tuned. You can email me (look at the source files) if you have any questions.
