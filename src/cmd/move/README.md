# A ranger rewrite, in Haskell. 

Part of the `vex` shell. A complete rewrite of ranger in haskell. Ranger is useful, but it's 
slow and there are several optimisations that I wanted to see happen, which did not materialise
fast enough. 

This project is currently a stub. Expected completion june 2023.
